An eclipse is an astronomical event that occurs when an astronomical object or spacecraft is temporarily obscured, by passing into the shadow of another body or by having another body pass between it and the viewer. This alignment of three celestial objects is known as a syzygy.[1] Apart from syzygy, the term eclipse is also used when a spacecraft reaches a position where it can observe two celestial bodies so aligned. An eclipse is the result of either an occultation (completely hidden) or a transit (partially hidden).The quantity of unique words in this file is: 59The quantity of unique words in this file is: 67The quantity of unique words in this file is: 68The quantity of unique words in this file is: 69The quantity of unique words in this file is: 70The quantity of unique words in this file is: 71
